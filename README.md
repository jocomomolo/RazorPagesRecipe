# JustRecipes
JustRecipes is a recipe site that lets you create and store recipes.

# Motivation
This is a beginner project and it is intended to use only by me / my nearest circle. It is thus designed to help me cook and plan grocery shopping.

Main features are:

* Easily **Create/Edit/Delete** Recipes. Quick overview of all Recipes.
* Have a **personalized Recipe Book** that contains **all** and **only** Recipes that I want.
* Show recipes in a **standarized** way. Avoid mountains of text before the recipes so typical of foodblogs: "When I was a boy, we spent our summers on the Maine coastline. Those were the best times of my life. The breeze through the sea grass, the waves breaking on the rocky shore, the lighthouses at night. And the fresh iced lemonade my grandmother made. That lemonade for me harkened back to a blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Refreshing blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Grandma blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
* **Adapt** recipe instructions so they are more logical/efficient: e.g. "preheat oven, cut all ingredients and reserve this and that" instead of "cut ingredient one, cook for 20 minutes, cut ingredient two, cook, preheat oven and now for another 20 minutes"
* **Optimize** the planning: lets me **filter** by e.g. Ingredient/Time/Untensil
* Include a list of **Utensils** right at the beginning to make sure you have all of them before starting
* **Stop scrolling up and down** with dirty hands: Keep all needed information in a single view: Ingredients, Description on a single view. Should be displayed also in small screens because that is what I actually bring to the kitchen.
